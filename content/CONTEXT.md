## Who Sean Is

Sean Roth is an AI developer and entrepreneur based in Colorado, relocating to Denver. He builds practical AI applications - tools that ship and solve real problems, not research projects or demos.

His path to AI engineering is non-linear: MA in Screenwriting from Chapman, 8,500+ ESL classes taught (including 3 years in Korea), IBM AI Developer certification, and currently building mathematical foundations through Math Academy.

This background gives him an unusual combination: deep technical capability plus genuine understanding of how to communicate complex ideas to people who aren't technical.

## Current Projects

### VFX Buddy
**What it is**: Automated rotoscoping tool for wedding videographers  
**Stack**: Python, Meta SAM 3, Flask, Stripe  
**Status**: Alpha, real users testing  
**URL**: vfxbuddy.ai

**The real story**: Wedding videographers spend hours on frame-by-frame mask creation. VFX Buddy uses Meta's Segment Anything Model 3 to generate professional selections in minutes. Sean built the complete product solo: landing page, payment processing (Stripe), video upload pipeline, mask generation, and delivery.

**What it demonstrates**: Computer vision in production, shipping complete products, understanding a niche market's pain points.

### Clara
**What it is**: AI orchestration system / personal assistant  
**Stack**: Python, Ollama, Anthropic API, Gemini, MCP, SQLite, Hume AI  
**Status**: Active development, daily use  
**Repo**: github.com/sean-roth/clara-ai

**The real story**: Clara is Sean's attempt to build a Jarvis-like system. It routes queries between local models (Ollama) and cloud APIs (Claude, Gemini) based on complexity. It maintains memory across conversations with importance scoring. It integrates tools via MCP protocol (web search, filesystem, databases). Voice interface coming via Hume AI TTS.

**What it demonstrates**: Multi-model orchestration, agent architecture, MCP protocol expertise, system design thinking.

### B2B Sales Agent
**What it is**: Automated prospect research and outreach pipeline  
**Stack**: Claude Code, Apollo MCP, Firecrawl, Gmail API  
**Status**: Running, actively used

**The real story**: Finding and researching prospects manually doesn't scale. This agent searches Apollo for leads matching an ICP, enriches them with web research via Firecrawl, generates personalized cold emails, and creates Gmail drafts for review. Sean uses it for VFX Buddy outreach.

**What it demonstrates**: MCP tool development, practical automation, understanding B2B workflows.

---

### AI Adoption Training
**What it is**: Course helping small businesses actually use AI  
**Focus**: Mindset and frameworks, not just tools  
**Status**: In development

**The real story**: Most AI training focuses on "here's how to use ChatGPT." Sean's course focuses on the harder problem: how do you think about AI integration? How do you identify where it helps vs. where it doesn't? How do you build workflows that actually stick? Focused on Anthropic ecosystem for enterprise credibility.

**What it demonstrates**: Can translate technical concepts for non-technical audiences, understands organizational adoption challenges.

---

### Freelance: Training Material Development
**What it is**: Converting SOPs into actual training materials  
**Status**: Active client work

**The real story**: Companies have SOPs that nobody reads. Sean takes those documents and transforms them into engaging training materials using AI-augmented workflows. What traditionally takes weeks, he does in days.

**What it demonstrates**: Real client work, practical AI application, understanding business processes.

## Technical Skills

### Strong
- **Computer Vision**: SAM, image segmentation, video processing
- **Agent Systems**: MCP protocol, tool use, orchestration, multi-model routing
- **LLMs**: Prompt engineering, RAG patterns, context management
- **Full-Stack**: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Flask, FastAPI, Laravel
- **APIs**: REST design, OAuth, webhook handling, Stripe integration

### Growing
- **MLOps**: Model deployment, monitoring (learning)
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS, Azure basics (expanding)
- **Local Inference**: Ollama, edge deployment considerations

### Not Yet (Honest Gaps)
- **Enterprise ML at Scale**: Haven't operated ML systems serving millions
- **Team Leadership**: Haven't managed engineering teams
- **PhD-Level Research**: Builder, not researcher
- **Mobile Development**: Web-focused

## Background That Matters

### 8,500+ ESL Classes
This isn't filler. Teaching that many classes means:
- Deep practice explaining complex ideas simply
- Understanding how people actually learn (not how we think they learn)
- Patience with the gap between expert knowledge and beginner understanding
- Real-time adaptation based on feedback

### Non-Linear Path
Screenwriting MA → ESL teaching → AI development looks scattered on a resume. The throughline: communication, understanding users, building things that help people learn and work better.

### Hardware Understanding
Sean does his own hardware repair and builds his own systems. He understands technology "from metal to LLM" - not just the software abstractions.

---

## What Sean Is Looking For

- Team where he can learn from experienced ML engineers
- Practical AI applications (not pure research)
- Ownership of meaningful features
- Remote or hybrid flexibility (relocating to Denver regardless)
- Health insurance (non-negotiable)
- Culture that values shipping over perfection

**Salary expectations**: $110k-$150k depending on role and company stage

---

## What Sean Brings

1. **Shipped products** - Not projects, products with real users
2. **Full-stack capability** - Can own features end-to-end
3. **Practical AI focus** - Solves problems, not chases hype
4. **Communication skills** - Can explain technical work to anyone
5. **Builder mindset** - Identifies problems, ships solutions, iterates
